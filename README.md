# Real-Estate-Management-Dashboard
1.	In this assignment, I have prepared a dashboard on Real Estate Management using Power BI from raw data having information regarding Property location, Price, Bedrooms, Floors, Waterfront, Condition, Year_Built & Year_Renovated.
2.	At first, we need to clean and transform the raw data and modify the columns as per our convenience.
3.	 And by using ‘Add Columns’, ‘Conditional Columns’ & ‘Custom Columns’ we could able to modify the columns of our data set.
4.	Then we should create multiple sub-tables of different columns and add new Index Column in the sub-tables so that we can link the sub-tables with the main table.
5.	We need to insert a new table where we could able to keep all our new measures to calculate different parameters that will be required in our dashboard visualization.
6.	Then using different measures, we have calculated the different percentage of condition status of the house, percentage of renovated and non-renovated houses, total houses having different no.of floors and bedrooms. And using slicers we could able to check all these parameters for different property location.
7.	We have also prepared a table showing information regarding the ‘Total Properties and its condition across different locations’ and ‘Total floors and its condition across different location’.
